# mapWDijkstras
Ever wondered how data structures can be used in real life? This project provides a practical application for the Dijkstra's shortest algorithm implementation. This project focuses on finding the shortest path between various cities all over New England.

## About The Project
I have gathered location data for various cities within New England. Using datascraping, I am able to create an undirected graph that depicts how each of these cities are connected.

<p>It is <strong> important to note, the shortest paths depicted are not the always the shortest path in real life. </strong> <br>This is due to the fact we made an undirected graph to represent paths between cities.</br>
<p>An example output of two cities is shown below:</p>
